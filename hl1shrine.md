I must start at the top and work my way down. (/s)

A game which is very near and dear to me, I played it when I was around 6 or 7. It was one of my first FPS games, or rather, Opposing Force was my first, and I played it without ever using the mouse. Very nostalgic.

To ask the question "Has Half-Life aged well?" we need to consider a few things. What did it mean to FPS gaming, indeed, gaming as a whole?

**Everything,** pretty much. While HL1 followed in the steps of Quake 2, or perhaps walked alongside them, HL1 raised the bar so much higher that Quake gave up and became an arena shooter. Ironically, each of the first 3 Quake games represents a completely different type of FPS gaming. Even Quake 4 has visions of Call of Duty, but it's much moreso Q2's sequel than anything else.

But that's just it. Half-Life 1, while not the very first game to attempt realistic locations, was one of the first narrative-based FPS games which did not merely *succeed*, it revolutionized the very genre as we knew it.

Not that I knew that as a child, of course.

HL1 did not simply 'age well', it redefined the very age that it came from. It almost single-handedly ended an era of gaming for a span of nearly 15 years, and even then, it took people wanting to reclaim some lost nostalgia and push back against modern, evolved sensibilities to find something comfortable again.

But, as we think about that, we run into an interesting irony. The span of classic FPS games, of so-called "boomer shooters", only lasted, what, 5 or 6 years? The scope of technology seemed to take huge leaps and bounds in the 90s, and I think in FPS gaming, that technology was almost as acute between Doom and Quake 1 as it was between Quake 1 and Half-Life 1.

But is that *really* true? Is Quake *really* that different from HL1 on a technological level? If we really broke down what made each game tick, how different, really, does HL1 end up being?

It has a use button. It has reloading. It has a flashlight. It has NPCs who follow you around and open up doors for you and talk to each other.

In truth, are any of these things actually *truly* that impressive compared to the gap between Doom and Quake?

No. They're not. They are, in truth, *small details* which all add to a greater whole. HL1 isn't impressive because it has reloading. It's impressive because it's taken a medium of gaming that has, only within the last half decade, truly come into its own... and it created something not just fun, but *interesting.* It made a living, breathing world. It immersed the player in a world that *existed*. That's precisely one of the things I think is truly underappreciated in retrospections of Half-Life 1. In a contemporary sense, the pre-incident chapter lets you see into a world not *entirely* dissimilar to our own.

A living, breathing world where people are suffering system crashes, where your coworkers are complaining about banalities, donuts, and workplace-mandated fashion. It is Science Fiction, and yet all the same, it's a relatable world populated with people that don't seem all that unbelievable.

Obviously, this is something we consider pretty normal today. It's a hallmark of good fiction, in my opinion. The thing is, these details simply *didn't really exist* with as much nuance in any FPS game *before* Half-Life.

This isn't to say that those small details don't make HL1 a more "modern-feeling" game. They do. As do monster behaviors like Barnacles eating HECU, or Bullsquids antagonizing Headcrabs. It's more than simple cause-and-effect, it's an ecosystem. In fact, more than simply being an ecosystem, it's a caste-based alien civilization with haves and have-nots.

Now, Xen's pretty divisive, and we'll get to that later, but basically what I'm trying to say is that HL1 raised the bar (Pun sort of intended) on what storytelling could be in an FPS game. More than simply cutscenes and epilogues, it told a story that you were *part of* rather than simply and solely being the hero of.

In fact, let's take a step back, and remove HL2 from the equation for a moment, and let's *really* think about the story.

Freeman is, in a sense, responsible for the deaths of all of his coworkers, almost to the last. Personally responsible, in self-defense, for the death of dozens of US Marines. Billions of dollars of property damage. Freeman pulled the trigger on a gun the size of a small land-locked country. Even if we don't consider the ramifications HL2 gives us, Freeman, even though his role at first was vanishingly small, is ultimately at ground zero of the single most destructive and calamitous workplace accident... of all time.

Freeman, the character, has no agency in this. He has no agency, because the G-Man has been pulling every string to make this happen. He has no agency because the Player is controlling his every single action personally. Freeman is, in no way, Free. The closure that you are rewarded with is the promise that your time will come again, and until that day comes... nothing. An inky blackness stretching out in every direction, forever. The toys are put away. The program is closed. The puppet, strings still attached, is placed back in his closet where he belongs.

But whether through copious amounts of adrenaline and morphine, the fight-or-flight response gives Freeman ultimately no time to 

But more than that, it presents an uncaring, callous management, concerned only with the newest and most profitable ideas, an adventurous sense of progress, with the most bare minimum long-term plan of infrastructure if something doesn't pan out. It is exactly this uncaring hand which you see in the form of the G-Man, impassively watching everything unfold, just out of reach, and never in danger. Never more to say than a shake of his head while he fixes his tie and departs wordlessly.

Right up until the very end, when it turns out that the callous hand of management is managing far more than just Black Mesa. The big uncaring hand in the sky has turned out even more uncaring, and by far bigger than you ever could have imagined. For all of your efforts, at the end of the day, you are left
