I must start at the top and work my way down. (/s)

A game which is very near and dear to me, I played it when I was around 6 or 7. It was one of my first FPS games, or rather, Opposing Force was my first, and I played it without ever using the mouse. Very nostalgic.

To ask the question "Has Half-Life aged well?" we need to consider a few things. What did it mean to FPS gaming, indeed, gaming as a whole?

**Everything,** pretty much. While HL1 followed in the steps of Quake 2, or perhaps walked alongside them, HL1 raised the bar so much higher that Quake gave up and became an arena shooter. Ironically, each of the first 3 Quake games represents a completely different type of FPS gaming. Even Quake 4 has visions of Call of Duty, but it's much moreso Q2's sequel than anything else.

But that's just it. Half-Life 1, while not the very first game to attempt realistic locations, was one of the first narrative-based FPS games which did not merely *succeed*, it revolutionized the very genre as we knew it.

Not that I knew that as a child, of course.

HL1 did not simply 'age well', it redefined the very age that it came from. It almost single-handedly ended an era of gaming for a span of nearly 15 years, and even then, it took people wanting to reclaim some lost nostalgia and push back against modern, evolved sensibilities to find something comfortable again.
