A *lot* of things are going to go here, but I'll probably have the newest stuff here, then older stuff on a dated table, with a further table for other specific fixations like Musou, RTS, FPS, et cetera.

For the time being, however, let's just get this going as a proof of concept.

|                Game                 |   Date   | Genre  |
| :---------------------------------: | :------: | ------ |
| [Half-Life](games/fps/half-life.md) | 9/8/2025 | FPS    |
|           nothing yet...            | Soon...  | tbd... |
