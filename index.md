# WELCOME TO SLEDGE WEBHOLE

This is a website to contain all of my myriad ramblings and bullshit. I play games! I play a lot of games. Sometimes, I watch anime, or even films! I have a lot of opinions, and sometimes, I wish I had a better place to scream those opinions into the unceasing void that is The World Wide Web.

## [Foreword](foreword.md)

At some point, or another, I will expand this site to eventually talk about all manner of things. RTS games, Diablo-style games, and, especially, FPS games. I have a lot of hyperfixations, and severe issues with doling out my time on the appropriate things, so this will be a *very* long work in progress. Pages are also due to evolve over time, as my thoughts on a game and my understanding of them evolve.

### Newest reviews will be at the top.
