# HALF-LIFE 1
#### [Back...](../../index.md)
# Background
Ground zero for the modern concept of an FPS. This game made tremendous waves, and shook the entire industry. There were a lot of reasons for this, and it certainly didn't come out of nowhere. This was *the* game to see and play from the moment it was announced all the way up to its release. Game of the Year, and for many, the Game of All Time. This game scarcely needs an introduction, but for the purposes of this website, of course we shall do the best that we can.

Today, we know Valve as the owners of Steam. Everyone, *everyone* knows Steam, if not Valve. Whether they are one of the many consumers, or some that revile its near-monopoly on PC gaming (outside of others like EA, Ubisoft, GOG, Epic, et cetera.), it is nonetheless a household name among PC gamers. But stepping back to 1996, it was founded, nominally, by two ex-employees of Microsoft. Gabe Newell, and Mike Harrington. I would say 'their stories aren't important to this', but, well, they are!

Quite a bit, in fact!

Gabe, you see, in his long-time service of Microsoft, was among the staff that developed Doom95. This is an immensely important part of the context that makes HL1 what it is. 'Horror' is an interesting word, one which seems to evolve over time both to individuals as well as to us as a society. Most people would not look at Doom, today, and think 'Horror.' But at the time of its release, it was, indeed, quite spooky. Very atmospheric, and, importantly, **extremely immersive.*** This will come up a lot.

Immersion and horror go hand in hand. Gabe saw the success of Doom--success even in excess of Windows itself. And, realizing that he had the potential to meet the same success himself, he decided to split off of Microsoft, and make *his own* Doom. A big part *of* Doom, we would learn later on, was the Doom Bible. Reading it today, you will find an *immense* number of ambitious, immersive ideas, especially on part of Tom Hall, as to *what* Doom should be, what it should contain, what features it should strive for.

Famously, or perhaps infamously, Half-Life would suffer from the very same type of ambition. Moss growing on textures in real time. A living ecosystem. Cockroach AI which would actually seek out trash and viscera so that it could feed. Some of these features actually made it into HL1, in the end! Others were quietly shelved to meet deadlines. But, without compromise what it gave us was *Immersion.* It gave us *Horror.* The very same immersion and horror that we saw 5 years prior in Doom.

Half-Life was, from its inception, a horror game. It was marketed as such. Its tutorial highlights the importance of using your flashlight in dark areas. Crawling through vents. Far more than Quake 1 or 2 were before it, we are taught early on the importance of *darkness*, and the things that hide in it.

But that horror extends past mere shapes in the dark! That horror extends to *miscommunication,* as US Marines descend from helicopters to erase your mistakes. *Mismanagement,* as the powers that be arranged for this apocalyptic event in the first place--bureaucracy at the head of science, pushing ever forward. A crushing, overwhelming sense that, in the end, *you are completely powerless to change your own fate.* **Horror.**

Opening the gates to an invasion of hellish beasts, an outmatched military, going through a portal and fixing problems on the other side, we must recognize an interesting parallel. Half-Life *is* Doom. It told the story, or at least *a form* of the story that Doom had once aspired to, and, just like Doom, it did so at the cutting edge of the technology which was possible at the time of its release. Both games sought out entertainment *and* immersion, and, in retrospect, as technology left both games behind, only the entertainment remained.

While we are left with a meaty narrative experience, we'll still take some time to talk about *what* that horror means to the rest of the game, and the means by which we actually achieved it.

# Technology
Based upon the then-cutting-edge Quake engine, Half-Life had a development cycle of around two years and some change. While they did pipe in a few of the changes from Q2's release, Quake 1 nonetheless served as a more important platform upon which this game was built. 3D rendering, hardware acceleration, lighting technology, etc. etc. A lot of this existed *in* Quake 1. Doors, even fancy doors. Moving platforms, to some extent, but they were considerably refined here, for this game. Not just *moving* platforms, but *drivable* platforms!

Now, it's true that by the time that HL actually launched, it almost certainly *barely* resembled Quake under the hood. I believe most of the engine was re-written from scratch, generally. But the two most major changes, I reckon, would be the AI, and the skeletal animation. The former allowed for more convincing and robust NPC behavior--not to say that infighting is impossible in Quake, by any means, but better pathing, more potential for scripted sequences, and, importantly, having friendlies who follow you around, yap at each other, and open up doors.

In other words, **immersion!**

The latter of aforementioned changes, skeletal animation, instead allows us to have more convincingly nuanced animations which aren't constantly bubbling and wobbling under the skin from their vertices contorting into new and exciting shapes. This allowed for more *complex* animations, more moving parts, more layers and granularity. Labcoats, gun magazines, complex actions like hanging onto a ladder... and falling off of it! With this increased fidelity, it, just as above, allowed us to create much more convincing situations that can unfold in front of the player.

Smaller changes, too, like reloading guns, being able to crouch, cranking valves to open doors, driving trains, or pester your coworkers for drugs or covering fire, (or ruining their microwave meal), are all things which added to this immersion. The very presence of a Use button allowing us to supplement Medikits with on-wall healing terminals and suit-charging stations further added to the idea that Black Mesa is a believable workplace. With this immersion came the ability to make the horror feel *all that much more* real. Technology came in pursuit of a convincing narrative, of immersive horror, and in, very simply, better presentation.

I promise that the chapter headers weren't supposed to work out *this* cleanly...
