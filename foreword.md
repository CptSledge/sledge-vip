# ABOUT THE AUTHOR

I'm Sledge! Known alternatively as CptSledge, Somagu, among many other progressively older and worse names. I am the owner of Hideous Destructor's semi-official Discord, and I am a long-term archivist of Doom mods, Roguelikes, and other such things. 

I like to analyze. I like to yap. 

You may have seen me on...

###### Surely not any other shady website that I would definitely not be stupid enough to use the same username on! (Note: eventually figure out how to make text small or colored! do html stuff, or something, if in fact I can do it in markdown at all! Probably not! Whatever! Not important!)

While this website is very much a work in progress, I'm hoping for it to be an interesting read. My thoughts on things are often much more extensive than what I communicate during or even after gameplay, but I lack the focus to put them down to pen the way that I should. Our first stopgap, besides the videos, streams, and vods themselves, is...

## [The review sheet!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W44ZbSPMsC4oGLUIeotIhLuD93oxoraRbM9WFMai__o)

This contains, to date, my most extensive list of thoughts currently available anywhere online. The earlier games don't have proper reviews, or even vods of any kind, but that may change some day. Hopefully, ideally, I will actually have webpages for every single one of these. But for the time being... I don't. That sheet should also have parity with this website. If it doesn't, I fucked up. (Please contact me.)
